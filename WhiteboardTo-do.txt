When resolving the merge conflict:


1. First “git pull”
2. The file with the merge conflict has a section starting with “<<<<<<< HEAD” and the first line below it contains what my version has. Then after the “========” line, there is a content from the remote repo.
3. Edit the section.
4. “Git add .”
5. “Git commit -m “Message”
6. “Git push origin master”
Conflict should be resolved.
